        <h1>History of Our Band</h1>
        <p>Originally the band is formed by Nijika (drummer) and Ryo Yamada (bassist), before Kita joins as guitarist and vocalist. However, Kita abruptly left the band, forcing Nijika to find a replacement, which led her to recruit Bocchi as the new lead guitarist just before their live performance. In the performance, they only perform instrumental songs due to their still lacking in vocalist. It was known that Ryo named the band after the word "cable tie" in Japanese, and intended as a pun. Kita rejoined the band after Bocchi recruited her back to the group, and solved her lack of skill issue which is the reason she quits.</p>

        <p>Kessoku Band performed the first two songs at the live house when auditioned by Seika, the manager, the first time they performed as four, one of them being "Guitar to Kodoku to Aoihoshi". The band performed again in their first live with the audience as a four-member band. The reception was originally dull due to low audience because of bad weather and their sloppy performance of "Guitar to Kodoku to Aoihoshi", but went better as they proceed to their next song, "Ano Band".</p>
        <p>The band performed in the cultural festival of Shuka High School, where Bocchi and Kita are students. This is also the first live in big venues with a public audience. While their first song "Wasurete Yaranai" went well, Bocchi's guitar snapped during the performance of "Seiza ni Naretara" but covered her solo by picking up the sake cup on the stage and performing slide guitar, awed the audience. However, the performance abruptly ended as Bocchi's stage dive attempt ended in failure and she was rushed to the infirmary. The incident went viral on the internet and became a hot topic for netizens on various social sites. This also however managed to expose the group further and their live performance in STARRY significantly increased later on.</p>
        <p>Another incident occurred after a certain live performance as a music blog writer, Poisonâ™¡Yami who attended the concert exposed the identity of the guitarist, Bocchi as guitarhero in OH!TUBE in front of the audience, and criticized the band soon after by accusing them of holding Bocchi's true potential back. While this incident was resolved with the management chasing the writer out, this also leads the band to participate in the competition of Mikakunin Riot.</p>
        <p>The band uploaded their reedited performance video in Shuka High in OH!TUBE as a promotion of the band for Mikakunin Riot, where this news reached one of the well-known metal bands, SIDEROS as well. Their vocalist, Yoyoko Ohtsuki managed to sneak in to watch one of their live performance before being caught by Hiroi who also attended the concert. Later, Kessoku Band and SIDEROS performed in SICK HACK solo live in FOLT as a guest performers, where the bands started to know each other.</p>
        <p>Kessoku Band uploaded their first music video along with their new song, "Gloomy Goodbye" in OH!TUBE. It reached 11,000 views after a certain short period. They also started their regular street live performance in Shimokitazawa as a means to promote their new song, which has been getting good reception from the audience.</p>

        <p>They managed to qualify for the preliminary demo review stage of Mikakunin Riot and ranked 28th place in the online voting stage of the competition, allowing them to proceed to the live judgment phase held in FOLT. However they did not manage to pass the stage.</p>
        <p>After the competition, however, they signed a label with Stray Beat with Miyako Shiba effectively becoming their manager from now on.</p>
